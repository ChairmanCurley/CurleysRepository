<h1>CAT STUFF</h1>
<p>Cats are curious, playful, and sometimes a little mischievous. They love to nap in sunny spots and chase anything that moves.</p>
<p>Also they are gloriously fluffy, which is always a bonus in my book!</p>
<p>Some of my favourite things about cats are as follows, although I'm sure that you'll have your own ideas on the best things about cats. I like it when cats are asleep, and it looks like they're dreaming because they start twitching and making noises - so cute. Something else I absolutely love is how much they like to snuggle and be close to you.
